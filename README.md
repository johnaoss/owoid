# owoid

A zig port of @bs2kbs2k's [uwuid](https://github.com/bs2kbs2k/uwuid)\

## Installation

I genuinely have no idea how Zig libraries are shared, but you can probably just copy `src/owo.zig` into your project assuming licensing is good.

## License

Follow the licensing from bs2kbs2k's uwuid project, and choose one of the licenses. 

## Why

I wanted to write something small in Zig to play around with it, and I did. 

## Why the name

Because OwO is close enough to UwU
